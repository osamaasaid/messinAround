    Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot.
    Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one
    how they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become
    television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that
    became nothing.

  <p>Anyways, These are some Lexuses:</p>
      <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-4 lexus"><img src="images/lexus1.jpg"></div>
          <div class="col-md-4 lexus"><img src="images/lexus2.jpg"></div>
          <div class="col-md-4 lexus"><img src="images/lexus3.jpg"></div>
      </div>

  <p>And these here are E30s:</p>

      <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-4 E30"><img src="images/E301.jpg"></div>
          <div class="col-md-4 E30"><img src="images/E302.jpg"></div>
          <div class="col-md-4 E30"><img src="images/E303.jpg"></div>
      </div>
         <center><h1><strong>SOME MORE B.S.</strong></h1></center>

    Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag
    clipped to my shirt with my name printed
    on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression
    on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when
    you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store.
    And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping
    for an infant named Jeb.
